### Pancreatic Tissue Imaging Exploration

#### Case Overview

This notebook explores a normal human pancreas sample from a 69-year-old donor (Data IDs: `SNT574.MMQC.683`, `SNT594.JCFN.856`, `SNT227.HLMG.672`). The selected tissue region features a large mucinous pancreatic duct expressing keratin 19 (KRT19), a surrounding layer of endocrine alpha cells, and additional layers of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and other stromal components.

Why This Case is Interesting? - This case offers a unique opportunity to study:

- **Transitional Zonation**: From ductal epithelium to endocrine islets to stromal tissue‚Äîideal for analyzing microenvironmental gradients.
- **KRT19 Expression**: A ductal marker often linked to progenitor-like states, providing a healthy baseline for comparison with disease states like PDAC.
- **Alpha Cell Localization**: Raises questions about islet neogenesis, cellular plasticity, or developmental remnants.
- **Stromal Interactions**: The presence of fibroblasts and endothelial cells supports exploration of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions.

This notebook integrates multiple imaging techniques:

1. **Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)** Highlights general tissue architecture. Nuclei: blue/purple; Cytoplasm/ECM: pink.

2. **Immunofluorescence (IF)** Visualizes specific proteins (e.g., Keratin 19, Glucagon, Insulin, CD31). Reveals molecular and functional cell details.

3. **Cell Mask (Bitmask)** Segmentation of individual cells. Enables spatial and morphological analysis.

#### Interactive Exploration with Vitessce

To ensure accurate cross-modality comparisons, the notebook applies pre-computed transformation matrices that rotate, scale, shear, and translate iamges. This aligns all imaging modalities to a common coordinate space (here, Xenium space).

The notebook uses the Vitessce viewer to enable:

- Layer toggling (e.g., IF, H&E, masks)
- Zooming and panning for fine detail inspection
- Channel and color control
- Opacity adjustment for blending modalities

This interactivity supports spatial analysis in fields like:

- Aging and senescence research
- Cancer research
- Diabetes and islet biology

This guide helps you set up a Python environment for working with Vitessce, NumPy, and Jupyter Notebook.
